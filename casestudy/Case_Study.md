There are 10 Co-Founders of Polygon; Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, Anurag Arjun, Mihailo Bjelic, David Schwartz, Jordi Baylina, Antoni Martin, Brendan Farmer, Daniel Lubarov, Bobbin Threadbare.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Polygon is a "decentralised Ethereum scaling platform that enables developers to build scalable user-friendly dApps with low transaction fees without ever sacrificing on security". It acts as a HOV lane that allows for faster and cheaper transactions for developers and users. 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The market cap for Polygon is $7.2 Billion. The funding, at first, came from private investors (the founders). In 2019 Polygon was lauched on BNB (Binance) allowing anyone to invest into their native coin. 

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Polygon is a Layer-2 solution, to bring scalability to the Ethereum network. It allows for an easy and secure way for developers to build dApps, with reduced transaction fees. The protocol "aims for faster, cheaper Ethereum transactions using sidechains". 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Polygon's intended customer are developers and people who want to use the Ethereum Blockchain, but are troubled by the fees and speed associated with Ethereum. There is 440,710 individual holders of the Polygon native token. 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Polygon's main competition is Polkadot (Dot). Matic wants to expand the Ethereum network by creating a "multi-chain system". Polkadot is a Layer-1 solution, which uses it's own blockchain, instead of Ethereum, to allow "communication" across multiple blockchains. Since Polygon is using the Ethereum network, it can take advantage of the security and decentralization of that network. Polygon is also a top 20 most popular cryptocurrency. The co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, heavily supports Polgon which is a major catalyst for Polygon. 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
Polygon use's PoS (Proof-of-stake), the same as Ethereum network. The technologies they are using is their own platform tools to allows developers to make dApps and deploy smart contracts. Developers can use Alchemy, Chainstack, QuickNode, and others, to depoly smart contracts on the Polygon network. Plasma technoledegy is one of the most essential features that have made Polygon so popular.

Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain. Specifically platform.

In November of 2021, the total cryptocurrency market cap was 3 Trillion dollars. Since 2013, hundreds of different protocols and solutions have been added to the overall domain. All these companies have created an increase of access so people can participate in this revolutionary tech. Large companies like BNB, Coinbase, and Crypto.com have launched mainstream advertising and easy-use platforms for people to use and invest in these companies.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Polygon's has promised a lot of solutions to the existing basenet. With over 1.7 million social media followers, Polygon has a large network of enthusiast. The popularity of Polygon is significant, with it being in the top 10 most mentioned projects. Polygon is one of the largest influencers in the "alt-coin" market. Polygon has also gone carbon neutral which is huge for the enviroment, but also working towards ESG compliance. Polygon has some of the most uses out of any other currency available, with over 19k dApps using Polygon to increase scalability.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The major metrics that companies use in this domain is market cap, security, and usability. The market cap of Polygon is less than 1% of the total market cap of crypto, but is ranked #13 compared to the rest. Making it one of the largest and most used projects in the domain. Security is a huge concern, and is a major reason why blockchain tech was created. PoS (Proof-of-Stake) is the gold standard of security in the cyrpto world. Since it "piggybacks" of the Ethereum network, it takes advantage of Ethereum's security. Polygon is a platform tech, which attempts to make using blockchain tech easier and more accesable to people and developers. With it being listed on every major exchange, and having a large social media following, Polygon is one of the most popular multi-chain tools around.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Polygon is competiting very well against other competitors in the same domain. During the recent economic turmoil that has reduced the overall market cap of cryto from $3 Trillion to around $1 Trillion, Polygon has kept its seat at the table. Some projects like Lunna, have completely failed. During a "down trend" in the market, companies can either build or fail. Polygon has stepped up to the plate and has continued to build and even released a new function this week called zkEVM.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
If I was to advise the company, I would look for ways to increase Polygon's adoption. Specifically for everyday users of crypto. They offer a native token that allows everyday individuals to invest into it's current ecosystem. Adoption is one of the biggest catalyst for a crypto company, since that is one the of fundemental ideas of crypto. To increase adoption, I would suggest they release a native app for Polygon users to be able to quickly use the financial services they provide. I would also suggest a way to increase awarness and education about Polygon to investors and people who are not familiar with the space. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I believe that increasing adoption and education of their service will drastically make Polygon even more popular. Crypto and Blockchain is complicated tech. If you were to explain the internet to someone in 1960's, they wouldn't have chance at understanding. The inital barrier for people to trust and understand their serivices must be one of the largest issues they face. You can sell and devlope a genious idea, but if no one understands it, their won't be adoption.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Technologies that this service would utilize is a developer platform and an educational tool. The devloper platform, that allows everday uses to utilize the financial services they provide. An educational tool to increase awarness and adoption for the network.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies are essential to my solution since their would be no other way to deploy the solutions. You would need to create a app or platform, which is a new piece of tech in its own. And a educational tool that actually works.
